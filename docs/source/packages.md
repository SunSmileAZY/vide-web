Packages
========

This part focuses on using `VIDE`, which is a browser based smart contract IDE. We will basically answer the question: 
Where can I use / download `VIDE`, and what is the difference between packages?

- An online version is available at [https://vechainstore.com/ide](https://vechainstore.com/ide). This version is stable and is updated at almost every release.
- Github repository: [https://github.com/mobileteamdev/vide-web](https://github.com/mobileteamdev/vide-web) . The source code is packaged at every release but still need to be built using `npm run build`.
