Welcome to VIDE documentation!
===============================

VIDE "Beta version" is developed based on Remix
VIDE is a powerful, open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser.
Written in JavaScript, VIDE supports usage in the browser.

VIDE also supports testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.

Our VIDE project with all its features is available
